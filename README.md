Ravenous is a website application that allows to create a playlist of music and save it to a Spotify account.

## Purpose of the Project  

Our project is to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Spotify API

## Features

- Users can search for songs by song title; we can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artistâ€™s name, genre, etc...
- Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried.
- Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account.

## Future work

1. Create the project and the components.
2. Modularize components by passing information between them.
3. Set the Search Bar's state by managing component state so that the application'components can function together as a team.
4. Interact with the Spotify API to get the data.
